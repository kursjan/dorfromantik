# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the stylistic and user experience standards for the Dorfromantik clone project.

## Prose & Communication
- **Tone:** Cozy and Playful. The language should be warm, inviting, and easy to understand.
- **Voice:** Like a helpful companion. Use encouraging and friendly prose in UI messages, tooltips, and any narrative elements.
- **Precision:** While playful, clarity is still key, especially for explaining game mechanics or tile properties.

## Visual Aesthetic & Design
- **Theme:** Organic & Warm.
- **Color Palette:** Soft, natural tones with an emphasis on greens, browns, and blues to represent landscapes.
- **Shapes:** Prefer rounded, organic shapes over harsh, sharp edges. The hexagonal grid should feel like a natural tapestry.
- **Texture:** A subtle, paper-like or hand-drawn texture should be applied to tiles and backgrounds to create a tactile, premium feel.
- **Depth:** Use multi-layered drop shadows to create a sense of depth between tiles and the background.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Zen Experience:** The gameplay should be meditative and low-pressure. Avoid stressful UI elements like timers or flashing red errors.
- **Fluid Navigation:** Hexagonal grid movement and interaction must feel natural and effortless. Use smooth animations for camera movements and tile placement.
- **Interface:** Keep the HUD minimalist to let the board and tiles take center stage.
- **Feedback:** Provide gentle, interactive feedback (e.g., soft "glow" effects) when hovering over potential placement spots.
